<p> <b> All these games are currently in development, the second "stage" of programming. </b> Planning is when an idea of a game pops up in mind and a group of people think about what it should feel like. Development is when the game is actually being programmed and all the functions are made, but it still isn't supposed to be tested yet. Alpha is when a game can be tested by a private trusted group of people then most of the bugs get patched before it releases to the public. Beta is the unofficial "soft" release where anyone can test the game and give feedback so the game can keep getting updated. The final release is when the game is officially open and 99% of the bugs have been patched. This is where the TRUE fun begins.</p>
